Let's get out of here
Let's have some fun, get nothing done
Let's disappear
It doesn't have to be real
It doesn't have to be anything
Still I will dig it in and dig it in
Together we could beautify
The beautiful inside ourselves
And magnify magnificence
To wear it, unbelievable
And then
We sat off from the saddle
The wist was left behind
We think of something better
We're not another kind
Girl, you take this in
I hop in blind, I'll beat them, show them where I've been
And I forgot about you, and I forgot about everything
And when I see you now I know this must be it
Together we could take the time
We need, to understand what we have
Seen, as those we were before
The fateful day when angels whispered
Now
We sat off from the saddle
The wist was left behind
We think of something better
We're not another kind
I hope you will sing this song with me
But it will haunt your memories
'Cause it has absolutely
Absolutely perfect melody

Together we could radiate
Around the clock for years
And never stop
We'd be the templates set
For happiness and
Universal
We sat off from the saddle
The wist was left behind
We think of something better
We're not another kind
